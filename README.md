## Why build this R package

> Currently, there is still no good tools for visualising the analysis
> results from `Seurat`, when the bioinformatics analyst hands over the
> results to the user, if the user does not have any R language
> foundation, it is still difficult to retrieve the results and
> re-analysis on their own, and this R package is designed to help such
> users to visualize and explore the anaysis results. The only thing to
> do for such users is to configure R and Rstudio on their own
> computers, and then install `SeuratExplorer`, without any other
> operations, an optional way is to upload the `Seurat object` file to a
> server which has been deployed with `shinyserver` and
> `SeuratExplorer`.

> Essentially, what `SeuratExplorer` done is just to perform visual
> operations for command line tools from `Seurat` or other packages.

## A live demo webserver

Upload an Rds or qs2 file, with file size no more than 5GB, to [Demo
Site](http://www.nibs.ac.cn:666/SeuratExplorer/). You can download a
mini demo data from
[github](https://github.com/fentouxungui/SeuratExplorerServer/blob/main/inst/extdata/demo/fly/Rds-file/G101_PC20res04.rds).

### Find Cluster Markers and DEGs Analysis

This usually takes longer, please wait patiently.Please save the results
before start a new analysis, the old results will be overwritten by the
new results, the results can be downloaded as `csv` format.

#### Support two ways

- support find markers for all clusters

- support calculate DEGs for self-defined two groups, you can subset
  cells before calculate DEGs between two groups, default use all cells
  of two groups.

You can modify part calculation parameters before a analysis.

> [FindMarkers(object,
> â€¦)](https://satijalab.org/seurat/reference/findmarkers)
>
> A data.frame with a ranked list of putative markers as rows, and
> associated statistics as columns (p-values, ROC score, etc., depending
> on the test used (test.use)). The following columns are always
> present:
>
> avg_logFC: log fold-chage of the average expression between the two
> groups. Positive values indicate that the gene is more highly
> expressed in the first group
>
> pct.1: The percentage of cells where the gene is detected in the first
> group
>
> pct.2: The percentage of cells where the gene is detected in the
> second group
>
> p_val_adj: Adjusted p-value, based on bonferroni correction using all
> genes in the dataset

### Top Expressed Features

Highly expressed genes can reflect the main functions of cells, there
two ways to do this. the first - `Find Top Genes by Cell` could find
gene only high express in a few cells, while the second -
`Find Top Genes by Accumulated UMI counts` is biased to find the highly
expressed genes in most cells by accumulated UMI counts.

#### 1. Find Top Genes by Cell

#### How?

Step1: for each cell, find genes that has high UMI percentage, for
example, if a cell has 10000 UMIs, and the `UMI percentage cutoff` is
set to 0.01, then all genes that has more than 10000 \* 0.01 = 100 UMIs
is thought to be the highly expressed genes for this cell.

Step2: summary those genes for each cluster, firstly get all highly
expressed genes in a cluster, some genes may has less cells, then for
each gene, count cells in which this genes is highly expressed, and also
calculate the mean and median UMI percentage in those highly expressed
cells.

<img src="inst/extdata/www/Find-Top-Genes-by-Cell.jpg" width="100%" />

#### Output description

- `celltype`: the cluster name which is define by
  `Choose A Cluster Resolution`

- `total.cells`: total cell in this cluster

- `Gene`: this Gene is highly expressed in at least 1 cell in this
  cluster

- `total.pos.cells`: how many cells express this gene

- `total.UMI.pct`: (all UMIs of this gene)/(total UMIs of this cluster)

- `cut.Cells`: how many cells highly express this gene

- `cut.pct.mean`: in those highly expressed cells, the mean expression
  percentage

- `cut.pct.median`: in those highly expressed cells, the median
  expression percentage

#### 2. Find Top Genes by Mean UMI counts

for each cluster, calculate the `top n` highly expressed genes by Mean
UMI counts. if a cluster has less than 3 cells, this cluster will be
escaped.

<img src="inst/extdata/www/Find-Top-Genes-by-Mean-UMI-counts.jpg" width="100%" />

#### Output description

- `CellType`: the cluster name which is define by
  `Choose A Cluster Resolution`

- `total.cells`: total cell in this cluster

- `Gene`: the `top n` highly expressed genes

- `total.pos.cells`: how many cells express this gene

- `MeanUMICounts`: (total accumulated UMI counts) / (total cells of this
  cluster)

- `PCT`: (total accumulated UMI counts of the gene) / (total UMIs of
  cluster cells)

### Feature Summary

Summary interested features by cluster, such as the positive cell
percentage and mean/median expression level.

<img src="inst/extdata/www/gene-short-summary.jpg" width="100%" />

#### Output description

- `celltype`: the cluster name which is define by
  `Choose A Cluster Resolution`

- `TotalCells`: total cell in this cluster

- `Gene`: the input genes

- `PCT`: the percentage of how many cells express this gene in this
  cluster

- `Expr.mean`: the mean normalized expression in this cluster

- `Expr.median`: the median normalized expression in this cluster

### Feature Correlation Analysis

Can calculate the correlation value of gene pairs within cells from a
cluster, support pearson & spearman methods.

#### 3 ways to do

- `Find Top Correlated Gene Pairs`: to find top 1000 correlated gene
  pairs

- `Find Correlated Genes for A Gene`: to find the most correlated genes
  for input genes

- `Calculate Correlation for A Gene List`: to calculate the correlation
  value for each pair of the input genes

<img src="inst/extdata/www/featurecorrelation.jpg" width="100%" />

#### Output description

<img src="inst/extdata/www/feature-correlation-output.jpg" width="40%" />

- `GeneA`: the first gene in a Gene pair

- `GeneB`: the second gene in a Gene pair

- `correlation`: the correlation value

if nothing return, this is because the input genes has very low
expression level, very low expressed genes will be removed before
analysis.
