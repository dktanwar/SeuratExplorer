# INTERACTIVE HEATMAP FIXED:

# Problem Identified ✅ 
- UI was still using old InteractiveComplexHeatmapOutput instead of plotlyOutput
- Server-side plotly_heatmap function was working correctly
- Mismatch between server (plotly::renderPlotly) and UI (InteractiveComplexHeatmapOutput)

# Root Cause ✅
- Line 299 in UI.R was calling InteractiveComplexHeatmap::InteractiveComplexHeatmapOutput("heatmap_interactive_plot")  
- But server was creating output$heatmap_interactive with plotly::renderPlotly
- Complete disconnect between UI output type and server output type

# Actual Fix Applied ✅
- Changed UI from InteractiveComplexHeatmapOutput to plotly::plotlyOutput("heatmap_interactive")
- Now UI matches server implementation 
- plotly_heatmap function tested and working correctly
- Server-side call simulation successful

# Technical Details ✅
- plotly_heatmap function creates proper plotly heatmap objects
- Handles group.by column checking with fallback to Seurat::Idents
- Includes performance warnings and error handling
- Server correctly calls plotly_heatmap with all required parameters

# STATUS: INTERACTIVE HEATMAP NOW WORKING ✅

The issue was purely a UI/server mismatch - the backend was correct but the frontend was trying to display the wrong output type.
