# Overall
- In interactive plots, use all possible selection options like lasso, pan, box, etc

# Dimentional Reduction plot
- theme working very well

- theme not working well

# Violin plot
- I enter 2 genes: cd4, cd44. Static plot splits into 2, but not interactive
- theme not working well

# dot plot

# Heatmap cell level
- Interactive plot is taking too much time. it should be fast like non interactive, like when i select only 2 genes

# Heatmap Group average
- nothing visible, panel size in non interactive? refer to: https://github.com/fentouxungui/SeuratExplorer
